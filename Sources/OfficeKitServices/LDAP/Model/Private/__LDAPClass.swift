/* Note:
 * For now we have decided to declare the classes and attributes directly in code.
 * This is great for convenience access to some attributes in a record.
 * However it is not flexible.
 *
 * The next step would probably to read the LDAP models directly, which would allow validation of attributes directly
 * I have never done that; I have currently no idea how it truly work and how feasible it is. */
